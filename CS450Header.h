/*  CS450Header5.h

    This file defines the format of the header block that is to precede each
    block of data transmitted for the CS 450 HW in Spring 2014.
    
    This is version 5 of this header, with fields added to support reliable
    data transfer over unreliable networks.  Any fields that are not currently 
    in use should be set to zero.
    
    Also, all loosely defined types, such as long int, that could vary from
    machine to machine have been converted to uint32_t or something like it,
    as described in 
    http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__avr__stdint.html.
